On July 22, 2016, Wikileaks published a collection of emails stolen from a Democratic National Committee computer (https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/). The theft of this data became known as the DNC hack.    This repository contains the code in which the data was analyzed with regard to PageRank and in-degree, among other things. In addition, a who-wrote-who graph was created. This is a directed graph in which the nodes represent the email addresses.  Below is a graph with the largest strictly related component. Graph drawing was created in Gephi.
